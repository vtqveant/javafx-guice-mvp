# JavaFX, Guice DI, Model-View-Presenter

This is a proof-of-concept architecture for JavaFX based on Dependency Injection, Model-View-Presenter 
([Passive View](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html) variant) and EventBus patterns. 
This architecture was popularized by [Ray Ryan's talk at Google I/O 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuhR18-EdM). 

Start with `$ mvn clean javafx:run` (works with maven 3.9.2)
